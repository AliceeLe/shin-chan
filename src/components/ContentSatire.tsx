        Representative of social functionings
      </h3>
      <p>
        A significant portion of the anime centers around the family life of the
        Nohara household. Shin's father, Hiroshi, works as a kakarichô (a
        low-level manager) at Futaba Shoji, while his mother, Misae, is a
        housewife. Both are depicted in stereotypical roles that reflect the
        traditional Japanese family structure, where the father is the sole
        breadwinner. Through the depiction of their daily lives, viewers gain
        insight into the social functioning of Japanese society. For instance,
        Hiroshi’s routine involves working long hours, enduring crowded trains,
        occasionally enjoying nightlife, and giving his entire take-home pay to
        his wife every month. Misae, on the other hand, is responsible for
        household chores and caring for the children, showcasing the domestic
        responsibilities typically assumed by women in traditional Japanese
        families. Despite their busy jobs, both Hiroshi and Misae still spend
        time with their children and go on family vacations regularly.

        Hierarchical structure of Asian families
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of the core aspects of Asian culture is respect for elders, which is
        prominently represented in the "Crayon Shin-chan" franchise. Shin is
        expected to listen to his family and teachers, encompassing not only
        obedience but also proper manners. However, Shin’s occasional rebellion
        and mischief, often leading to humorous situations, underline the
        expectation for him to adhere to the guidance of elders. Furthermore,
        the family dynamics are explored through the roles of Misae and Hiroshi.
        Misae serves as the main disciplinarian, reflecting the traditional
        expectation of mothers in Asian families to maintain order and
        discipline within the household. Hiroshi, on the other hand, provides
        financial stability, embodying the role of the head of the household
        responsible for the family's finances. This division of roles
        underscores the traditional gender roles prevalent in many Asian
        cultures.

      <h3 className="text-2xl text-galactic-blue">Dealing with Academics</h3>
      <p>
        The relationships between families and their children's academics are
        reflected through the contrast between Kazama’s family and Shin’s.
        Kazama is known to be smart and diligent. His parents are highly
        involved in his education, ensuring that he succeeds in his studies. As
        a result, Kazama always feels somewhat stressed because of the family’s
        expectations, which can be seen in many Asian families. On the other
        hand, Shin’s family is more lenient. Even though his parents often scold
        him for his laziness and disinterest in studying, they still prioritize
        his well-being. By showcasing these contrasting attitudes toward
        academics, the anime offers a nuanced view of the varying parental
        approaches within Japanese society.
